# VMH
Magma and GAP methods for working with arithmetic groups over imaginary quadratic number fields. These methods were primarily developed by Oliver Braun and Sebastian Sch√∂nnenbeck during their time as doctoral students at RWTH Aachen University funded by the DFG Research Training Group "Experimental and constructive algebra".

## Overview
The algorithms we implemented deal with groups of the form $GL_n(K)$ for $n=1,2$ and $K$ an imaginary number field. The following algorithms are available:
* Computing a presentation (i.e. generators and defining relations).
* Solving constructive membership problems (i.e. writing a given element in these generators).
* Computing a contractible G-complex which can be used for homology computations with the GAP-package [HAP](http://hamilton.nuigalway.ie/Hap/www/). These algorithms are also available for finite index subgroups of the base group (as long as we know the index and how to check for membership in this group).
